# markov chain project

## This is the final Project of a Python course on codeacademy pro: https://www.codecademy.com/final_project/python

The goal of this application is to use Markov Chains to generate new songs with lyrics in the style of Pulp singer Jarvis Cocker.

Descriptions of the project:

1. Fetch content from the web. To fetch Jarvis Cocker lyrics we will try to use musixmatch API (musixmatch.com)

2. Generate (train?) Markov chain with data.

3. Generate and display lyrics using Markov chain model.
