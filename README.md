# markov chain project

## This is the final Project of codeacademy Pro Python course: https://www.codecademy.com/final_project/python

The goal of this application is to use Markov Chains to generate new songs with lyrics in the style of Pulp singer Jarvis Cocker.

Description of the project:

1. Fetch content from the web. To fetch Jarvis Cocker lyrics we will try to use musixmatch API (musixmatch.com)

2. Generate and display lyrics using Markov chain model.
